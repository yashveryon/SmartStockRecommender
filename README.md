# SmartStockRecommender
üìñ Project Description

The Stock Recommendation System is a data-driven platform designed to assist investors in making informed decisions about stock investments. It combines time series forecasting with risk-return analysis to predict future stock prices and recommend optimal portfolio allocations across multiple sectors.

This project integrates two powerful modeling approaches:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classical statistical model for capturing linear trends and seasonality in stock prices.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model capable of learning complex patterns and long-term dependencies in sequential financial data.

The system processes historical stock price data, generates technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, MACD, and Bollinger Bands, and evaluates stocks using performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Volatility, Cumulative Returns, and Future Profitability.

The final recommendation is based on a weighted scoring approach, ranking the top-performing stocks from each sector and allocating user-defined capital proportionally to minimize risk while maximizing returns.

Interactive visualizations using Plotly provide a clear, intuitive representation of stock trends, sector-wise allocations, and portfolio performance, making it easier for users to interpret the model outputs and make investment decisions confidently.
